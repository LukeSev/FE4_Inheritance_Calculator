This is an Inheritance Stat Calculator for FE4.

In FE4, also known as Fire Emblem: Geneaology of the Holy War, there is a timeskip halfway through the game.
Before this timeskip, you have the option to pair up characters, who will then have children that you get in Gen 2 (post timeskip).
Pairing up units in Gen 1 grants a variety of advantages, namely better starting stats, items, and stat growths.
With how drastically pairings can alter a child character's abilities, optimization quickly becomes quite complex. This program aims to help simplify this process.
While there already exist online resources to give you the growth rates and expected starting stats for level 30 parents (which I would recommend, see: SerenesForest.net), I couldn't find anything to give you a child's starting stats given SPECIFIC stat layouts for parents, which can vary significantly due to RNG and/or stat boosters (visiting certain villages, participating in conversations, etc). As such, I thought I'd make something to do that for you.

Current Features:
- Given the parents' stats at the end of Gen 1, calculate the child(ren)'s starting stats and growth rates.
- Simple User Interface that lets you select the parents from a list and enter each parent's stats
   
   
TODO:
- ~~Add GUI to select parents and input stats~~
- Add support for displaying inherited personal skills
- Add support for displaying just stats or just growths
- Make UI look cleaner/more visually appealing
- Bundle into folder/exe using PyInstaller
